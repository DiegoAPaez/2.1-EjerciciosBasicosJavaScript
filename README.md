# 2.1 - Basic JavaScript Exercises

## 1.7: Promises & Async/Await

### Level 1

#### Exercise 1

Creating a Promise: Create a promise that resolves after 2 seconds and returns the string 'Hello, world'.

#### Exercise 2

Using a Promise: Use the promise created in the previous exercise. Create a `.then` that prints the result to the console.

#### Exercise 3

Promise with reject: Create a promise that resolves after 2 seconds if the input is equal to 'Hello', and rejects if the input is anything else.

#### Exercise 4

Using async/await: Write an asynchronous function that uses `await` to wait for the result of the promise created in Exercise 1, and then prints this result to the console.

### Level 2

#### Exercise 5

Error handling with async/await: Modify the function from Exercise 4 to catch any possible errors using a `try/catch` block.

### Level 3

#### Exercise 6

Promise.all: Create two promises that resolve after 2 and 3 seconds, respectively. Use `Promise.all` to wait for both promises to resolve, and print the results to the console.
