# 2.1 - Basic JavaScript Exercises

## 1.4: Rest & Spread operators

### Level 1

#### Exercise 1

Spread operator in arrays: Create two arrays, `array1` and `array2`. Use the spread operator to create a third array that contains all the elements of `array1` and `array2`.

#### Exercise 2

Rest operator in functions: Create a function `sum` that uses the rest operator to accept an indefinite number of arguments and return their sum.

### Level 2

#### Exercise 3

Copying objects with spread: Create an object `object1`. Then create a second object, `object2`, which is a copy of `object1` using the spread operator. Change a property of `object2` and verify that `object1` has not changed.

#### Exercise 4

Rest in destructuring: Create an array with several elements. Use destructuring and the rest operator to assign the first two elements to variables, and then assign the rest of the elements to a third variable.

### Level 3

#### Exercise 5

Spread in functions: Create a function that accepts three arguments. Then, create an array with three elements and call the function using the spread operator with that array.

#### Exercise 6

Merging objects with spread: Create two objects with different properties. Use the spread operator to merge these two objects into a new one.
