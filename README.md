# 2.1 - Basic JavaScript Exercises

## 1.5: Array transformations

### Level 1

#### Exercise 1

Map: You have an array of numbers `[1, 2, 3, 4]`. Create a new array that contains the square of each number.

#### Exercise 2

Filter: You have an array of numbers `[1, 2, 3, 4]`. Create a new array that only contains the even numbers.

#### Exercise 3

Find: You have an array of numbers `[1, 10, 8, 11]`. Use the `find` function to find the first number that is greater than 10.

#### Exercise 4

Reduce: You have an array of numbers `[13, 7, 8, 21]`. Use the `reduce` function to calculate the total sum of the numbers.

### Level 2

#### Exercise 5

Given an array `[1, 3, 7, 10, 15, 17, 11, 5, 8, 12, 9]`, create a one-liner function that does the following:

-   Filters numbers greater than or equal to 10.
-   Multiplies each filtered number by 2.
-   Calculates the sum of the filtered and multiplied numbers.
-   The function should return the result of the sum.

### Level 3

#### Exercise 6

Every / Some: Use `every` and `some` to determine if all or some of the elements in the array `[11, 12, 13, 14]` are greater than 10, respectively.
