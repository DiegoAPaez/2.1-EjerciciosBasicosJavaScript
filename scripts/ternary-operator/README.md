# 2.1 - Basic JavaScript Exercises

## 1.2: Ternary operator

### Level 1

#### Exercise 1

Basic ternary operator: Write a function `canDrive` that accepts age as a parameter and uses the ternary operator to determine if the user can drive. If the age is 18 or older, it should return 'You can drive'. Otherwise, it should return 'You cannot drive'.

#### Exercise 2

Using comparison operators: Write an expression that uses the ternary operator to determine which of the two given numbers (`num1` and `num2`) is greater. If `num1` is greater, return 'num1 is greater'. Otherwise, return 'num2 is greater'.

### Level 2

#### Exercise 3

Chained ternary operators: Write an expression that uses chained ternary operators to determine if a number is positive, negative, or zero.

Ternary operator with functions: Create a function `findMaximum` that accepts three parameters (`a`, `b`, `c`) and uses the ternary operator to determine the maximum value.

### Level 3

#### Exercise 4

Ternary operator inside a loop: Write a function `evenOrOdd` that accepts an array of numbers and uses a loop to iterate through the array. Inside the loop, use the ternary operator to determine if each number is even or odd.
