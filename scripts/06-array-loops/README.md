# 2.1 - Basic JavaScript Exercises

## 1.6: Array loops

### Level 1

#### Exercise 1

forEach: You have an array of names. Use `forEach` to print each name to the console: `let names = ['Anna', 'Bernat', 'Clara'];`.

#### Exercise 2

for-of: You have an array of names. Use a `for-of` loop to print each name to the console: `let names = ['Anna', 'Bernat', 'Clara'];`.

#### Exercise 3

Filter: You have an array of numbers. Use `filter` to create a new array that only contains the even numbers: `let numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6];`.

### Level 2

#### Exercise 4

for-in: You have an object with key-value pairs: `let obj = { name: 'Ola', age: 25, city: 'Barcelona' };`. Use a `for-in` loop to print each key and its corresponding value to the console.

#### Exercise 5

for-of with break: You have an array of numbers. Use a `for-of` loop to print the numbers to the console until you find the number 5, then stop the loop: `let numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6];`.

### Level 3

#### Exercise 6

for-of with index: Use a `for-of` loop to print each element of the array and its position (index) to the console: `let names = ['Anna', 'Bernat', 'Clara'];`.
