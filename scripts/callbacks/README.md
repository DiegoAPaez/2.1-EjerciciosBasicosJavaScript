# 2.1 - Basic JavaScript Exercises

## 1.3: Callbacks

### Level 1

#### Exercise 1

Basic callback: Write a function called `process` that accepts two parameters: a number and a callback function. The `process` function should invoke the callback function, passing the number as a parameter.

#### Exercise 2

Callbacks with mathematical operations: Write a function `calculator` that accepts three parameters: two numbers and a callback function. The `calculator` function should invoke the callback function with the two numbers as parameters. Then, call `calculator` with a function that performs the sum of the two numbers.

### Level 2

#### Exercise 3

Using callbacks in asynchronous functions: Write a function `waitAndGreet` that accepts two parameters: a name and a callback function. The function should wait for 2 seconds and then invoke the callback function, passing the name as a parameter.

#### Exercise 4

Callbacks with arrays: Write a function `processElements` that accepts two parameters: an array and a callback function. The `processElements` function should invoke the callback function for each element in the array.

### Level 3

#### Exercise 5

Write a function `processString` that accepts two parameters: a string and a callback function. The `processString` function should convert the string to uppercase and then invoke the callback function with the transformed string.
